ðŸš€ **Just published a deep dive into using GitHub as a complete blogging and document management platform!** 

After wrestling with traditional CMSs for years, I took a different approach: GitHub + Jekyll + GitHub Pages = zero hosting costs, version control for content, and lightning-fast performance. 

This article covers the real challenges I faced (like the mysterious empty index.html issue that took 8 hours to debug!), practical solutions, and why this approach might revolutionize how you think about content management.

Key highlights:
âœ… $0/month hosting with professional features
âœ… Git-based collaboration workflows
âœ… Automatic backups and version history
âœ… Sub-1-second page loads
âœ… Perfect for technical teams

Whether you're a developer tired of WordPress maintenance or a team looking for better content collaboration, this is worth a read.
