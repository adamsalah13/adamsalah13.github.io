# Test Article - Auto Discovery Working!

This is a **test article** to verify that our Jekyll collections system is working correctly.

## What This Tests

- âœ… Automatic file discovery in `_articles/` folder
- âœ… Front matter processing
- âœ… Collection rendering on homepage
- âœ… Individual article page generation

## How It Works

When you drop a new `.md` file into the `_articles/` folder with proper front matter, Jekyll automatically:

1. **Discovers** the file during build
2. **Processes** the front matter and content
3. **Generates** a dedicated page
4. **Lists** it on the homepage under "Technical Articles"

## Success Criteria

If you can see this article listed on the homepage, then auto-discovery is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
